Explanation of some configuration fields

server_pass
    Enter if broker is password protected. = and # are illegal characters due to
    parsing reasons.

backup_wifi_ssid
backup_wifi_pass
    The lamp supports editing of config fields wirelessly via the broker server.
    If something were to happen to the lamp's wifi network (say an SSID change)
    then the lamp would no longer be able to connect, and it would instead attempt
    to connect to the backup network and connect to the broker afterwards. This
    would allow the user to send the new updated configuration parameters to the
    lamp and therefore ensure a proper connection after reboot. This would therefore
    eliminate the need of software that can communicate with the lamp directly via
    wire. The backup wifi can be easily brought online with a smartphone's network
    sharing ability at need.

led_fast_tick_length
led_slow_tick_length
    When in a critical phase of the illumination sequence (when color or brightness
    changes rapidly), a too slow tick speed will look bad. When not in a critical
    phase, a too fast tick speed is unnecessary. Enter a fast one and a slow one,
    and allow the software to automatically switch between them.

sensor_placed_sensitivity
sensor_removed_sensitivity
    The sensor works by calculating the difference in value between two subsequent
    ticks. The value itself is derived from the hardware, and is within the range
    [0, 65535]. A difference that is bigger than the sensitivity will trigger 
    detection. This means that a shorter sensor tick interval will likely require
    a higher sensitivity. Also, changing the sensor tick interval too much will
    likely worsen the performance of this detection scheme.

active_duration
    When this lamp has been activated, it will remain so for some time. Meanwhile,
    it will both glow itself and trigger the friend's lamp to glow as well.

sleep_duration
    When sleep mode has been activated, all incoming messages (sleep, holding and
    activation) will be suppressed to prevent the user from being woken up. Instead
    of the usual behaviour, all messages will be rendered as a 3 second flash. This
    setting determines how long this mode will remain active. It will be inactivated
    earlier if the user activates this lamp as usual.

sleep_command_window
    Sleep mode is activated when the user presses down on the sensor twice within
    this specified time window.

hold_command_threshold
    When user is holding their hand on the sensor, it will after this duration enter
    holding mode, meaning that this and the friend's lamp will reenact a heartbeat.

active_color
sleep_color
    This lamp's activation and sleep mode colors. Can be entered as a RGB tuple
    (R, G, B) with each element taking values from 0 to 255 (inclusive), or as one of
    the predetermined colors:
        RED = (255, 0, 0)
        GREEN = (0, 255, 0)
        BLUE = (0, 0, 255)
        PURPLE = (255, 0, 255)
        WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
        CYAN = (0, 255, 255)
        YELLOW = (255, 255, 0)
        ORANGE = (255, 50, 0)
        PINK = (255, 30, 30)
        YELLOWORANGE = (255, 100, 0)
        ORANGERED = (255, 25, 0)
        CERISE = (255, 0, 50)
        REDPURPLE = (255, 0, 150)
